    Hey Buddy I have an  idea tell me is it worth it or not 
    Project idea : No code tool  
    I want to create a tool either website or an application which do 
    descryption : {
        The user can select their tech stack such as 
            - React + vite + tailwind 
            - React + vite + css
            - React + tailwind or css
        Like this the user can select their tech stack and then the user will chose their project title 
        The main functionalities are {
            - The UI has to look like penpot and figma 
            - The user can design the webpage 
            - The user can create "Components" & "Pages" as they want 
            - For every component the app in background create a component in react template and note how the user design the component
                and then store the properties 
            - The user can chose color add text also pass props and also get input
            - The design editor was like figma like drag and drop 
            - The user design pages by clicking + add pages -> in that page they can add what are the components 
                it has to render when the page is called with an "endpoint" like /home, /profile /notfound
            - The user can define every inch of their project 
            - In parrelel they design - the design has to convert to react code in the background
            
        } 
        Now the main part : 
            Apart from designing the user can add functionalities like {
                1. Create forms and transfer the data to the database 
                2. There has to be some default template in our app like login and signup forms , dahboard etc
                3. The user can create forms and select what field it should have like number , text, email and password 
                4. The user can add event listeners like scrolling and clicking also if they add an event {
                    - They can add an embed code or they can make the page redirect to other page /endpoints
                    - The user can add some basic animations also
                    - The user clicks add event and select event from dropdown and show what are the actions they can do 
                    - Make it user friendly like scratch for programming for kids its for react developer and designers for minimal design apps 
                }
            }
        The user can add API also {
            1. The user can select a database like mysql, oracle or postgresql and firebase
            2. The user can perform crud operations using those API's in the database also they can embed their own code API
            3. The user can select the API type such as eternal or db connection 
            4. You have to keep the app and code as minimal as possible 
        }
    }

    MOTO : The moto was to creat a no code tool to create react apps with minimal code structure instead of complex things 
            Anyone can create a react app - more was to create design with the use of our app 
            
    Final feature : 
        The user can download the design as figma or react code as zip 
        THe user also conect to their github and make a repo and perform add, commit , push from our app

    The app has to fast no use of database connectivity no external apis no high demand processes 
    This app was simple as possible the user design -> the react code generated based on it was a component or page or api -> user can download thier design
